                <h3>Ideal Clients</h3>
                <p>I love working with clients who value collaboration and are open to creative input. If you’re comfortable sharing your thoughts and welcome guidance on composition, color theory, and design aesthetics, I’m confident that together, we can bring your vision to life in a way that truly captures its essence and emotion.</p>

                <h3>Common Client Challenges</h3>
                <p>Have you been frustrated by designers who say your ideas are too complicated? Are you tired of hearing that the only solutions available involve high costs and compromise? Or maybe you’ve worked with designers who just don’t "get" the feeling you’re trying to convey. If any of this resonates with you, you’re in the right place.</p>

                <h3>Why Choose Marius Vision?</h3>
                <p>With over 50 completed projects and my work featured in <i>Women’s Wear Daily</i>, I am dedicated to pushing the boundaries of graphic design. Whether it’s photo editing and manipulation, product photography, or architectural rendering, I embrace every challenge—no idea is too difficult. At Marius Vision, imagination is the only limit. Let’s start a conversation about your next project.</p>

                <h3>What I Don't Do</h3>
                <p>If you're looking for CGI videos or expect a one-and-done transaction without ongoing collaboration, I might not be the best fit for you. Achieving the perfect result requires your feedback along the way—just a few simple comments at least to ensure we’re heading in the right direction.</p>

                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>I’m Marius Hagelskjær, a seasoned graphic designer from Denmark. With experience on platforms like Fiverr, I’ve honed my skills in Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and various aspects of 3D modeling and rendering. When I’m not crafting visuals, you’ll find me taking photos, traveling, or fighting on the tatami.</p>

                        <h3>Initial Contact</h3>
                        <p>The first step is reaching out to me with your project idea. This can be done via the contact form or directly through email. I’ll then set up a shared workspace on Notion for us to collaborate effectively.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Shared Workspace</h3>
                        <p>In Notion, you'll have access to a dedicated space where you can follow the progress of your project. Here, we’ll discuss and agree on the project’s scope, mood, and budget. *(An example of a Notion workspace image can be included here.)*</p>
