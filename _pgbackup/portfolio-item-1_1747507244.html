                            <p class="subtitle">Campaign for Urban Sophistication — lockdown edition</p>
                            <p>A visual narrative exploring connection during isolation. When Urban Sophistication approached me during lockdown with the challenge of bringing together 100 fans in a single image, we embarked on a journey that would evolve from a crowdsourced collage into something more resonant and intimate — a meditation on presence and absence in digital space.</p>

                            <h3>The Initial Approach</h3>
                            <p>During the height of lockdown, Urban Sophistication wanted to create something that would connect their community while acknowledging our collective isolation. We began with a democratic approach: inviting fans to contribute self-portraits taken at home, guided by a set of visual instructions I developed to create cohesion across varied environments.</p>

                            <p>As dozens of portraits arrived—raw, intimate glimpses into private spaces—I began composing them into a single image. Yet both the client and I felt something was missing. The crowd of faces created visual noise rather than connection, and the emotional weight of isolation was being lost in the density of the composition.</p>

                            <p>We pivoted, choosing to work with a smaller group of models who could represent the collection while allowing for more control over the visual language. In a studio setting, I directed these subjects—perfecting lighting, framing, and expression to capture the emotional tone we were seeking.</p>

                            <p>From these anchoring portraits, I began constructing a digital environment—not a literal space, but a visual metaphor for our collective experience. Through 3D modeling and careful composition, I created a room filled with screens, each displaying fragments of lives from the original submissions.</p>

                            <p>The room took shape: studio models existed in a constructed reality, surrounded by screens showing the community's submitted portraits—silent, glowing presences that spoke to our digital connectedness during physical separation. This layered approach allowed us to tell a more nuanced story about isolation and the new ways we were learning to be together.</p>

Each element was manipulated independently, allowing precise control over the visual narrative and emotional impact.</p>
