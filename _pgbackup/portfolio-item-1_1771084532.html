                            <p>When Urban Sophistication approached me during lockdown with the challenge of bringing together 100 fans in a single image, we embarked on a journey that would evolve from a crowdsourced collage into something more resonant and intimate — a meditation on presence and absence in digital space.</p>

                            <h3>The Initial Approach</h3>
                            <p>During the height of lockdown, Urban Sophistication wanted to create something that would connect their community while acknowledging our collective isolation. We began with a democratic approach: inviting fans to contribute self-portraits taken at home, guided by a set of visual instructions I developed to create cohesion across varied environments.</p>

                            <h3>We began by trying</h3>
                            <p>As dozens of portraits arrived—raw, intimate glimpses into private spaces—I began composing them into a single image. Yet both the client and I felt something was missing. The crowd of faces created visual noise rather than connection, and the emotional weight of isolation was being lost in the density of the composition.</p>

                            <p>Instead of forcing everyone into a single crowd, we began rethinking the idea together. What if the image reflected how we actually experienced lockdown — apart, connected only through screens? That thought became the foundation. I began designing a surreal room: shaped by distance, lit by screens, echoing the strange clarity of isolation. The space was developed through sketches, 3D models, and visual tests.</p>

                            <p>To populate the space, I collaborated with the client to instruct models remotely and in studio. We planned the lighting, angles, and mood to match the room's virtual logic. Even though the space didn't exist physically, it had to feel real. Every pose, shadow, and expression was designed with the room in mind.</p>

More importantly, it provided the community with a visual language for understanding our shared experience—acknowledging separation while celebrating connection.</p>
